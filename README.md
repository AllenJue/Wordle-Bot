# Wordle-Bot
## Introduction
Wordle-Bot is an interactive, user-friendly Wordle solver that takes in feedback from a user's Wordle results to give suggestions for finding a solution.

## Features
Wordle-Bot has a 6x5 grid, which resembles a Wordle Board. Upon clicking a square, it will toggle between grey, yellow, and green, which correspond with [Wordle's](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) features of invalid letters, misplaced letters, and correct letters. Typing letters will populate the empty squares for the current row, and pressing enter will attempt the guess. The Wordle-Bot will then process the given information and attempt to narrow down possible answers and provide a calculated guess.
